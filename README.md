# Idea

Easy way to find out a song's author age when they published a certain song. Just put song's name and artist's name, then the code will do all the stuff for you.

# Get Started

First steps:
`git clone https://github.com/s0ftik3/Artist-age.git`
`npm init`

Open `config.json` file in `config` directory and replace token's value. You have to get the token. Find out [here](https://docs.genius.com/#/getting-started-h1) how to do that.

Open `index.js` file and replace example song's name and artist's name to ones you want.

After you did all the stuff above, you can just open terminal and run `node -r @std/esm index.mjs`.
